# Weather-Dashboard-Erin-Mulcahey

## Description

My motivation was to build a weather dashboard that will fun in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS to show me weather for a selected city. I wanted to build this project so I could easily see the current weather in a given city. This dashboard coad could be changed to specifically give someone specific weather information to suite their needs. For now, the site shows a user the temp, humidity, and wind speed for the chosen city. It also shows a 5 day forcast, so the user can plan their future accordingly. This helps the user know what kind of weather to plan for. In created this website, I learned how to use an API and make multiple requests to that API.

## Usage

To use this website, the first step is for the user to enter a city name into the search fielt toward the top left. Once the user clicks submit, the page will show the entered city name on the top right box. It will also show the following: current weather inforamtion in the top right box, a 5-day weather forcast in the bottom right box, a list of previously searched citys in the bottom left box, and weather icons related to each day's weather. If a user wants to easily go back to a previously searched city, they can go to the history box (lower left box) and click on any of the listed cities. The page will bring up the current weather and 5-day forcast for the selected city.

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative file path, add it to your README using the following syntax:
